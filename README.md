# TravelGuide

Travel guide / Travel experiences is a web application for travellers community to share experiences, pictures, opinions, etc.

It's not focused in concrete business but the experience by itself.

Travel Experiences has been developed as a final project of the fullstack web developer bootcamp

# Technologies
Travel experiences is composed by:

* A backend server developed in NodeJS responsible for connecting to a MongoDB data base, storing application uploades (using multer) and serve the frontend requests
* A frontend server developed mainly in NodeJS, Typescript React and Redux, also integrating with the GoogleMaps API to show maps and positions in the front pages. Materialize CSS framework has been used to decorate the pages.

# WIP
Although the project has been successfully presented as a final project to obtain the graduate, there's much work to do, so this project will be upgraded regularly to include new features
